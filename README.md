# Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to improve the detection of fraud cases for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. By utilizing advanced machine learning models and detailed data analysis, we aim to accurately spot fraudulent activities. This helps prevent financial losses and builds trust with customers and financial institutions. The project also includes geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to enhance detection accuracy.


## Datasets
- **Fraud_Data.csv**: E-commerce transaction data aimed at identifying fraudulent activities.
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Maps IP addresses to countries.
- **creditcard.csv**: Bank transaction data specifically curated for fraud detection analysis.

## Features
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and data cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Merge datasets for geolocation analysis
  - Feature engineering (transaction frequency, velocity, time-based features)
  - Normalization and scaling
  - Encoding categorical features

- **Model Building and Training**:
  - Train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
  - Cross-validation

- **Model Deployment**:
  - Create REST APIs for model inference using Flask
  - Containerize the application using Docker
  - Deploy the models on a cloud platform
  - Set up real-time monitoring and logging

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-system.git
    cd fraud-detection-system
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
